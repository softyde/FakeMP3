# FakeMP3
A collection of fake MP3 files without content that can be used as placeholders for various use cases

A few days ago I needed some royalty-free MP3 files to create screenshots for an iPad app I was going to publish in the Apple store.

I ended up creating fake MP3 files with artist, album and cover to make my screenshots.

If anyone has a similar problem:
Here are the files. The covers are taken from public domain images from flickr. Titles, artists and albums I made up freely.
